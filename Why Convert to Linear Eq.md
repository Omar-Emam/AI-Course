Example of non-linear function:

At time t = 0 seconds, from a height of 100 meters, an object is released from a helicopter with zero initial speed. Until it is reaches ground, if we assume that it is subject only to gravity, then the object has height h = h(t), a QUADRATIC function of time t. In metric units, it’s: h(t) = -4.9 t^2 + 100

If we add the more reasonable assumption that there is also air resistance that is proportional at each moment to the speed of the object, we have a more complicated mathematical model that shows by a more complicated equation.

If we change that to assume air resistance proportional to speed squared, which seems to be the most preferred models in terms of approximating reality, we get still a different, complicated equation.

All of these functions are non-linear. As Alon Amit intimates in his answer, if you look around you in the world, most functions you consider to model reality will be non-linear. Linearity is a very special property not so much because anybody claims it to be ubiquitous - it’s not - but because, in cases where it can be used as an approximation, it is super-easy to calculate.
